## *Informations*

This application has been developed on the occasion for the **European Researchers' Night 2022**. It consists in _3 modes_:
<br>
- Player vs Algorithm, in a *speed race* after that the algorithm finds the labirint's exit
- Player vs Algorithm, in a *head-to-head challenge*, where 1 player's move (correct or not) is equivalent to algorithm's 1 step 
- Algorithm vs Algorithm, a *comparison* between 2 selected algorithms.
<br>
All labirint for the first 2 modes has been *generated randomly* and saved as template, instead in the third mode the labirint is generated randomly after the click on the button with the trophy

<br><br>

##### *Involved algorithms*

- Deep First Search o dfs
- Breath First Search o bf
- A*
- Faster A*, a reinterpretation of A* algorithm that is faster but does not guarantee the shortest path

<br>

##### *Programming languages used*

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- JSON
